## About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer based in Durham, North Carolina. Historically, I've worked as a full-stack developer. Now, I work as a .NET Core backend engineer at Wayfair.

Beyond software, I'm particularly fond of coffee-- learning about it, drinking it, etc.

I'm always looking for a cool project to work on.
